# Genetic-Algorithms-Image-Processing
This Python program processes images for genetic algorithm optimization. It includes functionalities for loading images, simplifying their color palette, calculating search space sizes, plotting data, and running a genetic algorithm to optimize image transformations based on simplified color schemes.

**Must update code, repo structure and readme!!**

This program is designed for image processing and optimization using genetic algorithms. It offers a variety of functions to load and preprocess images, simplify their color schemes, and calculate the complexity of their color combinations. It also features an extensive genetic algorithm implementation to evolve images towards a target configuration, optimizing their color representation and structure.

### Usage
Run the program to process images, compute their search spaces, and optimize them using genetic algorithms. Outputs include processed images, search space calculations, and visualizations of algorithmic performance.

Example Code
Here's how to run a genetic algorithm on a sample image:
```python
file_path = 'path/to/image.png'
n_iterations = 100
population_size = 50
crossover_rate = 0.8
mutation_rate = 0.01
replacement_rate = 1.0

best_image, best_score = genetic_algorithm(
    file_path, n_iterations, population_size, crossover_rate, mutation_rate, replacement_rate
)

print(f"Best score: {best_score}")
plt.imshow(best_image)
plt.title('Optimized Image')
plt.show()
```

This program provides a comprehensive toolset for manipulating and optimizing images using genetic algorithms. It can be particularly useful in fields such as digital art, pattern recognition, and other areas where image processing and optimization are required.
